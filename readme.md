## Usage

```
Usage: minichurch [OPTIONS]

  Simple lambda calculus executor, opens a repl shell if a file is not
  specified

Options:
  -f, --file FILENAME  Path to the file to parse
  -e, --explain        Flag to explain each association step
  -p, --parsetree      Flag to display the parse tree before the evaluation
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

Calling the minichurch command without any arguments will open a repl window.
### REPL Commands
- `exec [statement]` - executes a lambda calculus statement and displays the result (default behavior without any command)
- `explain [statement]` - executes a lambda calculus statement and displays the result along with every binding step
- `show [statement]` - parses a lambda calculus statement and displays the resulting parse tree
- `help` - displays the help menu
- `exit` - quits the REPL (can also be done with Ctrl-Z)
